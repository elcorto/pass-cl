* Add -n <line-number> option. For that split get_meta like so:

    get_content(){
        $GPG -d "${GPG_OPTS[@]}" "$passfile"
    }

    get_meta(){
        get_content | tail -n +2
    }

  and use get_content | tail ... | head ... to select the line.

* Add -s/--swap flag to swap the content of primary <-> clipboard. Needed when
  we want to paste a password in the shell using Shift-Ins, which only pastes
  primary. If there is a way to paste the clipboard in the shell, I'd really
  like to know.
